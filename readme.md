# We have 2 databases

Both databases are on the same ip and port

port: 5432

## Roman's database credentials:

## Silver's database credentials:

database name:silverphp

# Objective before deadline
For Roman: implement the part where you see what plants are on what planet.

For Silver: add plants to planets

# Private repository

This repository has to remain private because we haven't had time to implement storing credentials embedded in a system and therefore will store it in code.
